	-Added ar_object_to_hash(arObject) method
		This method is used to convert a ActiveRecord Object to a Hash.
	-Added similarity_of(arObject1,arObject2) method
		This method is used to get the similarity between 2 ActiveRecord objects returning a float where more similar it is more it gets close to 1.0 , and 1.0 means totally equal.
	-Changed pearson_correlation in order to filter non-integer values from the hash values.

	-Added Pearson Correlation comparsion function receiving 2 hash lists as parameters.

# Similarity Module

This module uses the **Pearson correlation coefficient** to measure similarity between two objects (typically ActiveRecord instances).

The coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, where:
- **1** indicates perfect similarity
- **0** indicates no similarity
- **-1** indicates perfect dissimilarity (inverse relationship)

## Examples in similarity context:

### 1 (Perfect Similarity)
Objects have identical attribute patterns.
\```
User1: {age: 25, posts: 10, karma: 100}
User2: {age: 30, posts: 12, karma: 120}
\```
(All attributes scale proportionally)

### 0 (No Similarity)
Objects have no discernible pattern in attributes.
\```
User1: {age: 25, posts: 100, karma: 50}
User2: {age: 50, posts: 10, karma: 500}
\```

### -1 (Perfect Dissimilarity)
Objects have inverse attribute patterns.
\```
Product1: {price: 100, stock: 50, sales: 1000}
Product2: {price: 50, stock: 100, sales: 500}
\```
(As one attribute increases, the other decreases proportionally)

In practice, most similarities fall between these extreme values.

## Usage
\```ruby
similarity = Similarity.similarity_of(object1, object2)
\```
